# Student for Business Informatics
My name is Alex, I'm 23 years old and live near Frankfurt am Main in Germany.    
I did an apprenticeship as technology officer and I'm currently studying Business Informatics in a dual way.  
The company I work for is Linde Material Handling/ KION Group AG, the university is Duale Hochschule Baden WÃ¼rttemberg Mosbach.   
On this profile I focus primary on school and private projects. 
I'm used to Java, Python, Angular and the web languages such as HTML, CSS & JS, but I'm always on the search for new challenges. 
Lets get in touch ;) I would be pleased if you join me on my journey.
